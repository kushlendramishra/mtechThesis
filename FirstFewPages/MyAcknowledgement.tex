I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis supervisor
Dr. Amitabha Mukerjee for giving me an opportunity to work with him. His
constant support, motivation, patience and insistence on exploring every
aspect of the problem have been instrumental in bringing this thesis to a
fruitful conclusion. I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Dr. S. P. Das for enlightening discussion and valuable suggestions.

I am grateful to my parents for their faith, love and values that have
always inspired me to walk upright. I would like to thank my brothers and
sisters for their unconditional love and support. Words fall far too short
of expressing what I want to for my Dadabhai, so I just thank him for being
my hero, embodiment of inspiration, pillar of strength, guide ...

I would like to thank Ankit, Anil, Rahul, Ankur, Preejesh and all other
friends for the long walks and endless non-technical discussions over
innumerable cups of chai. I would also like to thank Gaurav and Hashmi for
their friendship and support.

Finally, I would like to thank IIT Kanpur for providing  excellent
facilities and carefree learning environment.
